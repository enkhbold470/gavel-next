# Welcome to Gavel

Gavel uses a **pairwise comparison** system to rank projects. You'll be shown two projects at a time and asked to choose which one is better.

Please confirm the name of the project **immediately beforehand** with the team members at the table.

**Please don't skip unless absolutely necessary.** Skipping affects the quality of the final rankings.

**Once you make a decision, you can't take it back.** Please consider your choices carefully.
