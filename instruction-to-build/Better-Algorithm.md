A Better Approach
People are much better at making comparative judgements than determining absolute scores for options, and there’s a good amount of psychology and economics research to back up this claim1. Pairwise comparison is the way to go for obtaining high-quality judging results.

It’s easy to understand the advantages of this approach by considering examples. Try rating emacs on a scale of 1-10. Now think about whether vim is better than emacs (sorry, I couldn’t resist).

When collecting pairwise comparison data, we do have to be a little careful. Even though we won’t necessarily have comparison data between every pair of entries, we do not want disjoint sets of entries that are never even indirectly compared to each other. Ensuring that we have good data, we can use information from the comparisons to determine a global ranking.

The method of pairwise comparison has other nice properties as well. Luce’s choice axiom states that the probability of selecting one item over another from a pool of many items is not affected by the presence or absence of other items. This is a nice property to have when judges see a small percentage of the entries — taking this independence property into account can allow us to develop better models.

Pairwise comparison is clearly the right way to measure the quality of entries. The tricky part is how to turn the measurements into judging results.
