We had a giant expo to decide the top 10.

100 judges. 1000 participants. 90 minutes.

Everything here was managed by a computer, from real-time judge dispatch to rank computation. We used a system based on pairwise comparison, so judges would look at projects one after another, and for each project, decide if it was better or worse than the previously judged project.
